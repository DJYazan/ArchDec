#ArchDec V1 Beta

Hello, thanks for testing ArchDec V1 Beta.

This is still in beta so expect a lot of bugs and stuff, i will update the code time by time but this is a very early snapshot of the code.

No, the code is NOT open source and is not allowed to be used, skidded or claimed. I own this decompiler with some help. Credits are mentioned
